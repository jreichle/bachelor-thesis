\section{Motivation}
% FIXME: make more inciting
% FIXME: longer -> 0.5p
\ac{OCR} is the concept of extracting typed, handwritten or printed text
from an image.
Techniques for this concept have improved a lot due to the advances in the field of
\ac{DL}~\cite{zhao_improving_2020}.
\ac{DL} is a technology based on \acp{NN} where data is processed
in multiple layers to extract complex features and solve a given problem~\cite{shrestha_review_2019}.
\ac{DL} has only caught on in the recent years as the big computational cost has been met
by the improvement in computer hardware~\cite{ponti_everything_2017}.
Finding the right solution in the space of \ac{DL} and applying these new capabilities to
the use case of extracting information of labels is the focus of this thesis.

\section{Problem description}\label{se:problem}
% FIXME: more sources
The basic problem of this thesis is finding a viable solution for the extraction of textual
information from images with equipment labels.
However, it is difficult to assess how well an approach performs before it has been implemented and
tested on the specific problem or dataset~\cite{arpteg_software_2018}.
Therefore, it is useful to propose several approaches that might solve the problem from
different angles.

The problem has to first be analysed in depth in order to find a viable approaches for the solution.
This includes defining requirements such as detecting rotated text or given computational power
of mobile devices the solution.
These requirements define properties that an approach must have in order to be classified as viable.
Thus the reasearch and subsequent discussion of techniques from end-to-end \ac{OCR} to dividing the
process into text detection and text recognition is centered around the requirements which are
given by the problem.
Critical factors such as the requirement for data and the complexity of implementation and training
of a \ac{DL} model also need to be assessed.

Subsequent aspects such as implementation, training, deployment and maintenance of a solution in a
production environment shall not be performed within the scope of this thesis.
Because these aspects may vary depending on the approach, it is important to consider them when
discussing the viability for solving the problem.

\section{Methodology}\label{se:methodology}
The methodology of this thesis can be described as a literature review.
As such, the research question guiding the process is most crucial: Which state of the art \ac{DL}
approaches for \ac{OCR} are viable for the use case of extracting textual label data from
images.
The following section describes how relevant literature is identified, analysed and synthesised.

\section{Expected results}
% FIXME: k√ºrzen
In addition to a deeper understanding of the problem and its detailed definition, the literature
review lays the foundation for finding the right approach for the extraction of textual
information from images with equipment labels through literature review.
In the subsequent analysis different approaches are highlight for their theoretical fit as a solution.

In the following section the structure of this thesis is listed and each chapter's expected
result is detailed along with its benefits for the overall objective of producing an overview of
state of the art \ac{OCR} relevant for the problem described in Section~\ref{se:problem}.
comprehension of the following chapters is gathered.
This includes general principles of \ac{DL} and by extension \ac{ML} but also of \ac{OCR}.\@
In Chapter~\ref{ch:problem} the problem from Section~\ref{se:problem} is addressed in more detail.
The result shall be a firm understanding of functional and non-functional requirements both on the
technical and the business process side.
These requirements are the point of focus for the further examination of \ac{OCR} techniques.
After laying the foundation, in Chapter~\ref{ch:research} current research in regards to the
identified requirements is examined.
The resulting overview can be viewed as a basis for a decision when it comes implementing a practical
solution.
Therefore it enables the discussion in Chapter~\ref{ch:discussion}.
Here not only the results and the availability of a solution but also the methodology of this work
are assessed critically.
The conclusion is a summary of the results compared to the expected results detailed in this chapter
as well as an outlook for further research into the topic.
