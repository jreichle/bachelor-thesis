\textbf{Deep Learning based OCR}~\cite{zhao_improving_2020}
What is OCR:\ process of converting images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded one
includes two sub frameworks: text detection and text recognition

\subsection{Text detection}
Detect position coordinates containing text in input image
Text detection more challenging

Two object detection methods
\begin{itemize}
    \item R-CNN\\
        views detection problem as classification problem\\
        CNN to extract deep features of proposals by selective search\\ % TODO: research selective search
        Use SVM to classify with features
    \item YOLO
        extract feature maps on entire image\\
        directly regress bounding boxes on feature maps
\end{itemize}
YOLO generally slower but more accurate


\textbf{Deep Learning in Character Recognition Considering Pattern Invariance
Constraints}~\cite{oyedotun_deep_2015}
Neural networks can learn features of task on chich they are designed and trained
Neural networks better than other approaches (e.g.\ template matching, syntactic analysis)
$\rightarrow$ NNs can learn and adapt to moderate variations (e.g.\ translation, rotation, scaling,
noisy patterns)

Deep Learning: neural network architecture of more than a single hidden layer as opposed to shallow
networks
Features of deep networks: distributed representation of knowledge at each hidden layer, distinct
features are extracted by units or neurons in each hidden layer
several units can be active concurrently



\subsection{Character recognition}
Recognize text based on position coordinates

\section{Machine Learning}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Supervised --- Unsupervised
    \item Loss Function
    \item Optimization techniques: Stochastic-Batch Gradient Descent, GD Momentum, Adam
    \item Errors metrics
    \item Bias-Variance tradeoff (including Regularization)
\end{enumerate}


\section{Deep Learning}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item ANN / MLP % Node, Feedforward, Backpropagation
    \item CNN % layers --- convolutional, max-pooling
    \item RNN % recurrent layer
\end{enumerate}
