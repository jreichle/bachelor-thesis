\section{Reflection}
Challenges DL\cite{arpteg_software_2018}
Note that actual experiments with models have to be done
Problem: different papers have different components
$\rightarrow$ Hardware, Platform, Source Code, Configuration
$\rightarrow$ studies can't really be compared

`A major challenge in developing DL systems is the difficulties in estimating
the results before a system has been trained and tested.'~\cite{arpteg_software_2018}

\section{Outlook}
