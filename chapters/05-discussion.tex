\section{Reflection}
Challenges DL\citep{arpteg_software_2018}
Note that actual experiments with models have to be done
Problem: different papers have different components
$\rightarrow$ Hardware, Platform, Source Code, Configuration
$\rightarrow$ studies can't really be compared

`A major challenge in developing DL systems is the difficulties in estimating
the results before a system has been trained and tested.'~\citep{arpteg_software_2018}

Threats to validity!

\section{Outlook}

What to do next: next steps
Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Data Labeling, Model Training, Model Evaluation, Model Deployment,
Model Monitoring~\cite{watanabe_preliminary_2019}
