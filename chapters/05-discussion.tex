\section{Analysis}
Go down hierarchy and compare most important advances

For comparison: which Benchmark Dataset fits the problem the best?
ResNet is pretty much the Feature Extractor Benchmark

Recognition
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ability to cope with 2d text:
        CTC has problems,
        Attention/Encoder-Decoder based can be extended to work
    \item CTC prone to overfitting
    \item Attention has problems with long sequences
\end{itemize}


\section{Reflection}
Threats to validity!
\begin{itemize}
    \item~\cite{arpteg_software_2018}: different papers have different components
        $\rightarrow$ Hardware, Platform, Source Code, Configuration
        $\rightarrow$ studies can't really be compared
    \item~\cite{arpteg_software_2018}: `A major challenge in developing DL systems is the
        difficulties in estimating the results before a system has been trained and tested.'
    \item~\cite{long_scene_2021}: different interpretations of metrics (matching for \ac{STD},
        word/char for \ac{STR})
    \item~\cite{siebert_construction_2021,nakamichi_requirements-driven_2020}: all entities of
        \ac{MLS} should be inspected when developing a solution
    \item~\cite{baek_what_2019}: different papers use different evaluation and testing environments
    \item~\cite{baek_what_2019}: different papers use different subsets of the same dataset
        $\rightarrow$ discrepancies in performance
    \item~\cite{long_unrealtext_2020}: half of the widely adopted benchmark datasets have imperfect
        annotations $\rightarrow$ ignoring case-sensitivities and punctuations, and provide new
        annotations for those datasets
    \item~\cite{chen_text_2021}: inconsistency of datasets, priors and testing environments make
        comparison difficult
\end{itemize}

\section{Outlook}
What to do next: next steps --- lifecycle
$\rightarrow$
Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Data Labeling, Model Training, Model Evaluation, Model Deployment,
Model Monitoring~\cite{watanabe_preliminary_2019}

Use Neural Architecture Search to automatically find right feature extractor~\citep{zhao_improving_2020}
