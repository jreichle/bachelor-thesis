\subsection{Approach Research}
\subsubsection*{GitHub implementation}
Two models that can be used in conjunction

\textbf{detection}~\cite{beom_text_2021}\\
uses RetinaNet structure~\cite{lin_focal_2018}
applies techniques from textboxes++~\cite{liao_textboxes_2018}

\textbf{character recognition}~\cite{beom_crnn_2021}\\
needs cropped text area as input\\
uses CRNN~\cite{shi_end--end_2015} $\rightarrow$ end-to-end learning, LSTM fir arbitrary length of
input and output, no need to apply detection and cropping to each single character

\subsubsection*{Tesseract}
Open Source OCR engine~\cite{smith_overview_2007}
\begin{itemize}
    \item uses Deep Learning (found c++ code for layers in repo)
    \item Processing in step-by-step pipeline, some unusual stages\\
        1. Line and Word finding\\
        1.1. Line finding\\
        1.2. Baseline Fitting\\
        1.3. Fixed Pitch Detection and Chopping\\
        1.4. Proportional Word Finding\\
        2. Word Recognition\\
        2.1 Chopping Joined Characters\\
        2.2 Accociating Broken Characters\\
        3. Static Character Classifier\\
        3.1 Features\\
        3.2 Classification\\
        3.3 Training Data\\
        4. Linguistic Analysis\\
        5. Adaptive Classifier
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{EAST}
