\begin{itemize}
    \item~\cite{watanabe_preliminary_2019}:next steps to practically solve problem
        $\rightarrow$  Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Data Labeling, Model Training,
        Model Evaluation, Model Deployment, Model Monitoring
    \item~\cite{zhao_improving_2020}: Use Neural Architecture Search to automatically find right
        feature extractor
    \item~\cite{siebert_construction_2021,nakamichi_requirements-driven_2020}: build system around
        model $\rightarrow$ e.g.\ supervision mechanism
    \item~\cite{shi_icdar2017_2017,he_icpr2018_2018}: adjust field to better metrics for evaluation
    \item~\cite{long_scene_2021}: general trend to move towards simpler,shorter pipeline
\end{itemize}
