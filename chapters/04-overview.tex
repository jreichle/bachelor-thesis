What is wrong with scene text recognition model comparison\section{Different pipeline Frameworks}
\cite{baek_what_2019}
Four stages derived from existing STR-Models
\begin{itemize}
    \item Transformation: normalize input image $\rightarrow$ Spatial Transormer Network
    \item Feature extraction: map input image to representation that focuses on relevant attributes,
        while suppressing irrelevant features
    \item Sequence Modeling: capture contextual information within sequence of characters
    \item Prediction: estimate output character sequence
\end{itemize}

Text Recognition in the Wild: A Survey~\citep{chen_text_2021}
\begin{itemize}
    \item pipeline
        \begin{itemize}
            \item text detection: text localization \& text verification
            \item (Text Segmentation)
            \item Text Recognition
        \end{itemize}
    \item various stages of \ac{OCR}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item text localization: localize text components, group into candidate text regions with
                as little background as possible, DNN
            \item text verification: verify text candidate regions as text or non-text,
                filter false-positives, CNN
            \item text detection: determine whether text is present using localization and verification
                procedures, basis for end-to-end, can be regression or segmentation based
            \item text segmentation: most challenging, includes text line (splitting a region of multiple
                text lines into subregion of single text lines) and character segmentation (separating
                text instance into single characters, typically used in earlier approaches)
            \item text recognition: translates cropped text instance image into target string sequence,
                basis for end-to-end, DL encoder-decoder frameworks
            \item end-to-end-system: given scene text image $\rightarrow$ convert all text regions into
                target string sequences, includes detectoin, recognition and postprocessing, can be
                seen as indipendent subproblems but also joint by sharing information
        \end{itemize}
    \item text enhancement: recover degraded text, improve text resolution, remove distortions,
        remove background $\rightarrow$ reduce difficulty of recognition
\end{itemize}

Challenges in input preprocessing for mobile OCR applications~\cite{sourvanos_challenges_2018}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Acquistion: obtaining image --- digitization, binarization, compression
    \item Preprocessing: enhancing image quality --- noise removal, skew removal, thinning,
        morphological operations
    \item Segmentation: separating structural elements --- implicit and explicit segmentation
    \item Feature extraction: generating salient features --- geometrical, statistical
    \item Classification: categorizing individual characters to their respective classes --- clustering,
        neural networks, bayesian models, etc.
    \item Post-processing: improving and filtering --- contextual approaches, multiple classifiers,
        dictionary based approaches
\end{itemize}
