When determining whether automisation is an improvement four aspects have to be examined.
These are time, costs, quality and flexibility.
The aspects build a quadrangle that is based on the optimizing trade-off between the
factors~\cite{dumas_fundamentals_2013}.

Without software supporting the task of reading the name of the picture  and typing it into
the system, can take long seconds, whereas a trained Deep Learning model could complete the task
in a mere instant.
Therefor automisation via Deep Learning should improve the efficiency of the process when compared to
manually reading and typing the information off the image.

Training costs for a Deep Learning model are very high due to the computing intensive
backpropagation algorithm that tunes the network to the data.
But the usage cost is low.
For manual labor the opposite is the case as training a person to type in a label is done quickly
and labor costs are high in comparison to the expenses for running the model.

Both Deep Learning models and human labor are not 100\% accurate.
It is human to make mistakes and because Deep Learning is trained only trained on a specific set
of data it makes sense that not all predictions can be correct as there can always be outliers in
the data. % TODO: find source
The question is whether the model can be as accurate or even better than its human counterpart.
This is especially interesting when it is applied in the real world where it might have to do good
in subpar situations.
An example is bad image quality.

Flexibility is concerned with how well a process can adjust to changing requirements.
A set of new equipment names that have to be included can pose a problem to a Deep Learning model
because it is not trained for the new data.
A human on the other hand should not have any problems in this regard.

The main concern for the solution's efficacy is whether it is accurate enough.
Therefor this work focuses on this aspect in particular.
